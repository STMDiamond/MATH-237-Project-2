# MATH-237-Project-2
Hi there and welcome to the page for my second project in MATH 237. Focusing on the Student Performance dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, my project is meant to analyze how various student factors affect their academic performance in the form of points. As such, these aspects are the student's daily time taken traveling from home to school in minutes, their weekly time spent studying in hours, the times that they have failed a previous class, and the times they have been absent from school. To sum everything up, I carry out the following steps to answer my research questions:
1. Data Preparation – Import the appropriate libraries, load the entire dataset, and look at all of the variables.
2. Missing Data – Search for any missing values and focus on the five variables listed above.
3. Feature Engineering – Use a mix of one-hot encoding, binning, scaling, and interaction features for the chosen variables.
4. Data Plots – Generate bar plots along with boxplots for two of the variables while using histograms as well as scatterplots for the other two variables.
5. Multiple Linear Regression – Separate the data with a 80-20 split, form a correlation matrix, scale both sets, train the new model, examine each coefficient, and test both sets' accuracy.
6. Ethical Concerns and Data Limitations – Discuss a few possible problems with how the data was collected and talk about any important points that may have been missed.
Note: For both the "Feature Engineering" and "Data Plots" parts, I used the key below to distinguish between the five variables within the graphs.
* Brown – Number of Student's Absences
* Light Red, Yellow, Neon Green, and Cyan – Daily Time Taken Traveling From Home to School in Minutes
* Red, Gold, Green, and Blue – Weekly Time Spent Studying in Hours
* Purple – Number of Student's Failures
* Pink – Number of Student's Absences
